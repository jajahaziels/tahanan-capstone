    <h1>Landlord Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our <strong>Web-based Apartment Management Platform Incorporating Tenant and Landlord Features with Real-Time Communication and Locations Mapping</strong>. 
        As a landlord, you agree to the terms and responsibilities below to ensure fair and transparent property management within the system.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Landlord Information Collection</h2>
        <p>Landlords must provide accurate and verifiable information to maintain transparency and trust within the
            platform. The following data may be required for verification:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full name and contact details</li>
            <li>Government-issued valid ID (e.g., Driver’s License, Passport, or National ID)</li>
            <li>Proof of property ownership or authorization (e.g., land title, lease agreement, or certification)</li>
            <li>Property details such as address, images, rental rates, and descriptions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Submitted documents are strictly confidential and reviewed only by authorized administrators. Data will be
            deleted upon request or once the academic project concludes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Landlord Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Landlords must post accurate property information and respond promptly to tenant inquiries or maintenance
            requests. False, misleading, or exaggerated property details are prohibited.</p>
        <p>Repeated violations may result in account suspension or removal.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Respect and Professional Conduct</h2>
        <p>Landlords must maintain professionalism when communicating with tenants. Harassment, discrimination, or
            offensive remarks are not tolerated.</p>
        <p>All interactions should align with ethical standards and respect both parties’ privacy and dignity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Real-Time Communication</h2>
        <p>The platform’s messaging feature allows direct communication between landlords and tenants. Landlords are
            expected to use this feature responsibly and avoid sharing unnecessary or sensitive information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Location Mapping</h2>
        <p>Landlords must ensure that uploaded property locations are accurate and legitimate. The mapping feature
            exists to help tenants locate properties easily and should not be used to mislead users.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Payment Reminders</h2>
        <p>The system provides rent payment reminders to assist landlords in monitoring due dates. However, all
            transactions must occur directly between the landlord and tenant.</p>
        <p>The platform does not process or store any payments.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. System Usage</h2>
        <p>Landlords must refrain from unauthorized access, data modification, or actions that could harm platform
            integrity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Updates to Terms</h2>
        <p>These terms may change periodically. Continued use of the platform means acceptance of the updated
            conditions.</p>
